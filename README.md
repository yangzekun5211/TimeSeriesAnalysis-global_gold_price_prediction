Aims
Time series analysis is aways an interesting topic to me, and the gold price is another one. In this notebook I will analysis the global monthly gold price data during 1970 to 2021. I will first analysis its instincts as a time series, and then try to predict the gold price for the next month by some famous time series prediction methods. After that, I will go further and collect some data from website to dig out what're the factors that will influence the global gold price.
